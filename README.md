# 🧠 Linux System Health Monitor

A simple **Bash-based system monitoring script** that displays real-time information about your system’s performance — including CPU usage, memory status, disk space, logged-in users, and the top processes consuming resources.

It’s designed for **Linux**, but also works on **macOS** since both are Unix-based. Perfect for learning Linux shell scripting and demonstrating automation concepts.
